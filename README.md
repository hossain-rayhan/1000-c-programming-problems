## Chapter 1: Play with printf()
In this chapter, we discuss the process of printing statements in C programming. The examples show various techinques to print in differnt styles using `printf()` function. 
- ***Problem 1:*** Print the skeleton of a C program. [[solution]](chapter-1/chapter-1-solution.md#probem-1)
- ***Problem 2:*** Print `Hello World` using a C program. [[solution]](chapter-1/chapter-1-solution.md#probem-2)
- ***Problem 3:*** Write a program which will print `Hello` and `World` in two different lines. [[solution]](chapter-1/chapter-1-solution.md#probem-3)
- ***Problem 4:*** Write a program which will print "Hello &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World". Remember, there is a tab (4 spaces) in between "Hello" and "World". [[solution]](chapter-1/chapter-1-solution.md#probem-4)
